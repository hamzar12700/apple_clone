                Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they
                purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may
                vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer
                subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the
                value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in
                their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
                statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers
                selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall
                receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This
                will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by the
                instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift
                Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the
                original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be
                charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product. Apple
                Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at
                checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple
                Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
                <span class="desc">support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</span> for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on
                when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024:
                Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness.
                Rates as of February 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and
                fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using
                ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI
                purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to
                select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is
                always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online
                at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase
                Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or
                on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price,
                less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time
                for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible products. See
                support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple
                Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI financing. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs
                Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available for qualifying applicants in the United States. If you reside
